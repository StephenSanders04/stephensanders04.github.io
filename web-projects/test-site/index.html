      <p>My name is Stephen Sanders and this is my web page! My intent behind making this page is to further my 
       understanding of the web. By developing this page, I hope to gain a better grasp of the inner workings of the web,
       allowing me to identify vulnerabilities more effectively in other pages. Creating this page has also increased my
       proficiency in JavaScript. My ultimate goal is to become a pentester and I am hoping this is a step in the right direction.</p>
